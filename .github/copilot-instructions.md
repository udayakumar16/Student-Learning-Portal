- Use TypeScript throughout (frontend + backend).
- Keep REST APIs under `backend/src/routes` and mount under `/api/*`.
- Do not introduce new frameworks beyond Next.js, Express, MongoDB/Mongoose.
- Prefer small, focused patches; do not reformat unrelated files.
- Frontend should call backend using `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` and attach `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
